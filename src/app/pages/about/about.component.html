<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I first learnt about software developement in GCSE Computing, Where I started working with Python.
    This continued in my A-levels where I continued to learn about Python, moving onto more object oriented code,
    and making my first big project; A program for a local school that let teachers and students see what rooms
    were free to use and book them. In the summer of my second year I learnt C so that I could join the robotics
    club to perform at the world skills show, winning gold. I was also lucky enough to gain some work experience
    at the Hertfordshire Police HQ where I shadowed the IT and developer team for a week, I got to learn about software
    development in a proffesional enviroment. And it was from here I knew for definite I wanted to pursue a
    career in software development. I didn't know how to fulfill this goal, I spent 2 years at university and although
    I learnt alot, it wasn't the road I wanted to go down. So I now work at attend2IT where I started as a junior technician,
    but after showing my passion for software, have been able to move into the developement department. I am currently looking
    for the next step in my career where I can learn more and work full as a software developer.

<h1>Education</h1>

<h2>Games Programming at the university of gloucstershire 2017-2019</h2>
<p>I studied games programming learning how to use Unity and c# aswell as C++ in order to develop video games. 
    In the first year I achived a 1:1 and learnt alot about software development. Some projects I am particularly
    proud of such as my sprite editor can be found on the projects page. Unfortunately, I did not complete my full course
    as, after a long time deciding if it was right for me, I decided university was not the enviroment for me.
    But I have still seen the benefit of the time I did partake, as it gave me the experience to be able to transfer to
    a job working with software.

<h1>Work Experience</h1>

<h2>May 2019-Present Attend2IT</h2>
<p>I am currenttly working in a split role at Attend2IT, where I spend half of my time as a junior event IT technician,
    and the other half working as a developer. Some of the work I undertake includes setting up IT services at events,
    such as CCTV systems, Wifi and networks, Phone networks, EPOS systems and more. When an event is fully set up,
    I check on clients ensuring they know how to use and are happy with the Wifi services and the software.
    On the developer side, I develop web apps using angular, create wordpress websites, maintain the ticket scanner's
    software, and more. Our developer enviroment uses both mac and windows to develop, aswell as using bitbucket for
    version control. And we make use of AWS to assist with our web apps. I also sometimes undertake warehouse duties,
    where I ensure the right equipment gets sent on the right events using Easyjob, and work at configuring switches,
    iPads, NVRs etc to ensure they are ready.
