            <h4>The Frontend</h4>
            <p>I love to use React or Angular for my frontends with great experience in both. 
                And have a lot of experience building server rendered front ends using Visual Basic .NET</p>
            <p>I have implemented with many enterprise level third party APIs such as Microsoft Graph, Xero/Quickbooks, MalwareBytes and Keap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card fullWidth right">
            <h4>The Backend</h4>
            <p>I have experience building out large databases on Microsoft SQL Server, using T-SQL to create complex procedures and views.</p>
            <p>When it comes to hosting I have a mix of experience between AWS, Azure and IIS.<br>
                For AWS I am capable of using S3 and CloudFront to build scalable websites as well as API Gateway and Lambda to setup APIs</p>
            <p>To Link it all together, I have developed APIs both directly in Express.JS and using Loopback to quickly scaffold APIs.</p>

                <h5>Details</h5>
                <p>I undertook 2 years of a BSc. course in producing video games using game engines such as unity.
                    I produced many 2D and 3D games such as working with a team of designers in order to create a 3D
                    racing
                    game. I also created desktop apps such as a sprite editing app. I was unfortunately unable to
                    complete
                    the course.
