            <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
            <p>Hi! I am a Web Developer based in Hertfordshire. <br><br> I have {{getExperience('May 1, 2019')}}
                years of industry experience producing software across a broad range of requirements, with a focus on
                JavaScript web applications.</p>
            <p>
                My skills take me across the whole developement cycle from business analysis with a client, <br> To
                developing the entire stack of an app
                all the way to ensuring it is properly hosted and supported in it's life.

                <h4>The Frontend</h4>
                <p>I love to use React or Angular for my frontends and understand the need for UI that is performant and
                    mobile first. <br>
                    And I also produce server rendered front ends using VB.NET for all in one solutions.</p>
                <a href="/projects/1">Example of an Angular App</a><br>
                <a href="/projects/13">Example of a React App</a><br>
                <a href="/projects/TODO">Example of a VB.NET App</a>
                <p>I have built frontends on multiple platforms such as mobile with Ionic alongside Angular, as well as
                    React based PWAs.
                    <br>I have also built desktop native solutions using tools such as Electron and WPF.
                </p>
                <a href="/projects/6">Example of an Electron app</a><br>
                <a href="/projects/4">Example of a WPF app</a>
                <p>I have integrated with many enterprise level third party APIs such as Microsoft Graph,
                    Xero/Quickbooks, MalwareBytes and Plaid. <br>
                    And I fully understand the latest API standards such as Oauth</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h4>The Backend</h4>
                <p>I know how to build out large databases on Microsoft SQL Server, using T-SQL to create complex
                    procedures and views.</p>
                <a href="/projects/13">Example of an app that uses a T-SQL DB</a>
                <p>When it comes to hosting I have a mix of experience between AWS and IIS and have touched upon
                    Azure.<br>
                    For AWS I am capable of using S3 and CloudFront to build scalable websites as well as API Gateway
                    and Lambda to setup APIs.<br>
                    When it comes to IIS I know how to set up and manage privately hosted sites on VPS's as well as
                    ensure they are secure by producing SSL certificates through CertifyTheWeb
                </p>
                <a href="/projects/1">Example of a project hosted on AWS s3</a>
                <p>To link it all together, I have developed REST APIs both directly in Express.JS and using Loopback 3
                    and 4 to quickly scaffold APIs. <br>
                    I also know how to script in PowerShell to produce useful server scripts such as regular data feeds
                    from one database to another.</p>

                    <p>I undertook 2 years of a BSc. course in producing video games using game engines such as unity.
                        I produced many 2D and 3D games such as working with a team of designers in order to create a 3D
                        racing
                        game. I also created desktop apps such as a sprite editing app. I was unfortunately unable to
                        complete
                        the course.
