    <h4>Work Experience at the Hertfordshire Police HQ > May 2015</h4>

        <p>
            I had the opportunity to attend a couple of weeks work experience at the Hertfordshire Police
            HQ. Here I shadowed their IT team as well as the in house developers.
            I learnt alot about repairing IT equipment as well as seeing hands on how software developers
            worked in the industry.

    <h4>Gold medal at the World Skills Show > Nov. 2016</h4>
    <section>
        <p>
            Paired with an engineer I went to the world skills show at the NEC,
            to represent my school in undertaking a 48hr compeititon with teams from other schools and universities.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to create an autonomous robot capable of detecting RFID coloured tags on objects
            scattered around an arena and then move them to corresponding nets.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had to quickly learn how to use C while my engineer developed the robot. Then within the 2 days I
            developed
            an AI that could patrol the arena and scan objects it came across.
        </p>
        <p>
            I take great pride in the fact I was able to win the gold medal in this competition!
