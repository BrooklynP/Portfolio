            <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
            <p>Hi! I am a Web Developer based in Hertfordshire. <br><br> I have {{getExperience('May 1, 2019')}}
                years of industry experience producing software across a broad range of requirements, with a focus on
                JavaScript web applications.</p>
            <p>
                My skills take me across the whole development lifecycle all the way from business analysis with a
                client, <br> to
                developing the entire stack of an app
                and then ensuring it is properly hosted and supported throughout its life.

                <h4>The Frontend</h4>
                <p>
                    I am currently enjoying using React for my frontend as well as some past experience with Angular.
                    <br>
                    Over time I have come to understand the need for responsive UI, as more people use devices of
                    varying sizes, including mobile. <br>
                    So I leverage modern techniques such as the Bootstrap CSS toolkit and create websites that function
                    as PWAs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I have experience developing VB.NET apps for server side rendering,
                    as I've found the Infragistics UI tables to be highly efficient for displaying large amounts of SQL
                    data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And for the desktop I have created both WPF and Electron apps.
                </p>

                    <a href="/projects/5">Angular Example</a> -

                </p>
                <p>I have integrated with many enterprise-level third-party APIs such as Microsoft Graph,
                    Xero/Quickbooks, MalwareBytes and Plaid.</p>

                <h4>The Backend</h4>
                <p>
                    I have a deep knowledge of SQL, mainly focusing on Microsoft SQL Server.
                    I am experienced in writing out complex procedures and views and using SQL Server tools to 
                    create indexes etc. to ensure they are being run efficiently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When it comes to hosting I have a mix of experience between AWS and IIS. And have touched upon
                    Azure.<br>
                    For AWS  I have used S3 and CloudFront to host scalable websites as well as API Gateway
                    and Lambda to setup APIs.<br>
                    When it comes to IIS, I know how to set up and manage sites on local servers as well as
                    ensure they are secure by producing SSL certificates through CertifyTheWeb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To link it all together, I have developed APIs with Express and Node.JS, as well as using Loopback 3/4 to quickly scaffold APIs. <br>
                    I also know how to script in PowerShell to produce useful server scripts such as regular data feeds
                    from one database to another.

                    <p>I undertook 2 years of a BSc. course in producing video games using game engines such as unity.
                        I produced many 2D and 3D games such as working with a team of designers in order to create a 3D
                        racing
                        game. I also created desktop apps such as a sprite editing app. I was unfortunately unable to

                        the course.
