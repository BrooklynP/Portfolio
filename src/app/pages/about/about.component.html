    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        <!-- I first learnt about software developement in GCSE Computing, Where I started working with Python.
        This continued in my A-levels where I continued to learn about Python, moving onto more object oriented code,
        and making my first big project; A program for a local school that let teachers and students see what rooms
        were free to use and book them. In the summer of my second year I learnt C so that I could join the robotics
        club to perform at the world skills show, winning gold. I was also lucky enough to gain some work experience
        at the Hertfordshire Police HQ where I shadowed the IT and developer team for a week, I got to learn about
        software
        development in a proffesional enviroment. And it was from here I knew for definite I wanted to pursue a
        career in software development. I didn't know how to fulfill this goal, I spent 2 years at university and
        although
        I learnt alot, it wasn't the road I wanted to go down. So I now work at attend2IT where I started as a junior
        technician,
        but after showing my passion for software, have been able to move into the developement department. I am
        currently looking
        for the next step in my career where I can learn more and work full as a software developer. -->

                <h1>May 2019-Present Attend2IT</h1>
                <p>
                    I am currenttly working in a split role at Attend2IT.<br>
                    I spend half of my time as a juniorevent IT technician, and the other half working as a developer.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the work I undertake includes setting up IT services at events, such as CCTV systems, Wifi
                    and networks, Phone networks, EPOS systems and more. <br>
                    When an event is fully set up, I check on clients ensuring they know how to use and are happy with
                    the Wifi services and the software.<br><br>
                    On the developer side, I develop web apps using angular, create wordpress websites, maintain the
                    ticket
                    scanner's software, and more. <br> Our developer enviroment uses both mac and windows to develop,
                    aswell
                    as using
                    bitbucket for version control. And we make use of AWS to assist with our web apps.

                <h1>Games Programming at the university of gloucstershire 2017-2019</h1>
                <p>
                    I studied games programming learning how to use Unity and c# aswell as C++ in order to develop video
                    games.
                    In the first year I achived a 1:1 and learnt alot about software development. Some projects I am
                    particularly
                    proud of such as my sprite editor can be found on the projects page. Unfortunately, I did not
                    complete
                    my
                    full
                    course
                    as, after a long time deciding if it was right for me, I decided university was not the enviroment
                    for
                    me.
                    But I have still seen the benefit of the time I did partake, as it gave me the experience to be able
                    to
                    transfer
                    to
                    a job working with software.
