            I am a full stack web developer with a wealth of skills across multiple technologies. 
            With almost 4  years of industry experience I know how to take ownership of projects across their full life cycle.
            From  requirements analysis to developing the entire stack of an app,
            all the way to ensuring it is properly hosted and supported. 
            I am now looking for my next big step.

            <p>
                Programmer chosen by my school team to undertake a 48hr competition 
                in which I had to create an autonomous robot capable of detecting RFID tags on objects scattered around a ring 
                and then moving them to their correct pit. 
                I quickly learnt the programming language C and proved I could build a working program within strict time constraints. 
                I take great pride in winning the gold medal in this competition and beating university teams as a sixth form student.
